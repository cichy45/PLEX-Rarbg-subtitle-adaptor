# PLEX-Rarbg-subtitle-adaptor

This script must be run inside folder that holds folders of 1080p x265 movies.

It will rename all English, German, Polish subtitles with addition of .eng/.ger/.pol before .srt. This way plex will recognise external subtitles with respect to language. It will also delete all other subtitles and .txt and .exe files.

Use this scirpt to move all subs from Subs folder to main movie folder:
